# SpriteGenerator
A simple 2D Sprite and SpriteSheet Generator from 3D models and Image Editor to tweak visuals of your sprites and SpriteSheets.
This was created primarily for myself and tailored for my personal project needs. Therefore, this is very much specific to what I needed and wanted a simple, "pixel-like" look and feel for Low-Poly Models. 
Feel free to contribute, use or tweak it. This is very much under heavy development and it's not a finished product. I would say this is definetly something like an "pre-Alpha" development stage, but the key features are there and working. 


## Features
* Written in C#, it can be run as standalone Application if required
* Generate Sprite and Sprite Sheets from 3D models
* Leverage Godot's Animation Player to define the Animations for Sprites
* Allows for Sprites and Sprite sheets to be generated with or without Animations.
* Includes a simple Image Editor to apply Color Reduction and to tweak image Saturation, Brightness, etc.
* Multiple options to tweak the Sprite Size, Resolution and Effects (Sprite size up to 512px)
* Allow Replaceble parts (To tweak and add armour or replace parts of your model with Gear or Weapon, etc) 
* Includes usual Sprite and Spritesheet effects like Inline, Outline, Color Reduction and others
* You can load external Palettes to change the colors of your Sprites and SpriteSheets
* Comes with a Prebuilt model and dozens of animations for you to use
* You can add your own models with your own animations (from blender or any other software). 

## Getting Started

1. Read the [How to Use](https://github.com/DanTrz/GodotSpriteGenerator/blob/main/HOWTOUSE.md) instructions.

2. Youtube video (WORK IN PROGRESS) [tutorial videos](https://).

## Future Roadmap and ToDos
This is not a finished project, but there are some things that I would like to add in the future.
- [ ] Allow to save configuration and load presets (Current Save Functionality is broken)
- [ ] Documentation is missing. I will add proper comments in the Code and add a Docs page to make it easier if anyone wants to reuse or contribute
- [ ] Allow import of external models (Simplify the process via an Importer Button)
- [ ] Copy sprites and sprite sheets from Sprite Generator to Image Editor
- [ ] Tweak the logic for Color Reduction 
- [ ] Performance Improvements
- [ ] Add additional models I have (I plan to do this in the future, adding about 5 built-in models)
- [ ] Tweak Color Reduction logic and Shader (To make it more efficient)
- [ ] Bug Fixing and Stability Improvements
